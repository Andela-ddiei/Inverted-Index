# Inverted Index
## Background Information

- In computer science, an inverted index is an index data structure storing a mapping from content such as words or numbers, 
- to its locations in a database file, or in a document or a set of documents. The purpose of an inverted index 
- is to allow fast full text searches, at a cost of increased processing when a document is added to the database.

- Common applications include search engine algorithms and biometrics.

## Features

- Users should be able to click an 'Upload File' to upload book files
- Users should be able to click a 'Create Index' button to create an Inverted for uploaded files
- Users should be able to search through files that have been indexed
- A table similar to that displayed in the Inverted Index resource should be displayed when an Index is created
- All search results should be displayed in a similar format with the table displayed above
- The application will allow users upload a JSON file

## Why is this project useful

- Inverted index ensures fast processing when working with very large record files.
- It is the most popular data structure used in document retrieval systems.

## How users can get started with the project
